# Hello!
My name is Salih, a `Technical Communications` graduate from `The Ohio State University` and currently working as a `Freelance Technical Writer` in the US.
- [My Github Portfolio](https://github.com/SalihWarsama/)
- [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salihwarsama/)

Feel free to reach out to me through email: [](salihwarsama@gmail.com).

# Purpose of this Site
This site is where I will create various and engaging forms of technical documentation that cover various types of topics, products, and services for *no charge* and for *all to use!* I will also post about general technical topics, concepts, how-to guides, tutorials, recommendations, and more.

# Who Is This For?
For anyone who is willing to expand their technical expertise in general or in specific areas, such as writing, research, design, or if you're only interested in practical things such as what resources I use: **this site is for you!**

# How I Made This Site
This site couldn't have been built without [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator with the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/). This site is also configured with `GitHub Actions` for automatic deployment to this site's host, `GitHub Pages`, whenever I push changes on the CLI or on GitHub. This site will be live and accessible **24/7**, and since it's all open source, you can view it here on [GitHub](https://github.com/SalihWarsama/salihwarsama.github.io)!
