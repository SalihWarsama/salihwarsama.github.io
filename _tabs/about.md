# Hello!

![About](/assets/img/linkedin-banner.JPG)

My name is Salih, a `Technical Communications` graduate from `The Ohio State University` and currently working as a `Freelance Technical Writer` in the US.

At Ohio State, I did a lot of `User Experience(UX) Research` and created several studies with my collegues to collect and analyze users' problems in various product designs, with my most notable study being the `Google AI Overview`. My team effectively pinpointed user pain points of these designs and created prototypes that users found more satisfactory, backed by statistically significant data.

After graduating, my gears shifted. Sure, I still enjoyed helping others through research and data analytics, but I wanted to help *more* people with *more* things, outside of just design. So, I decided to create tutorials and such for others online, which at the time **I didn't even know was an occupation!**

Now, I'm working on this ~~passion project~~ blog that you see right now! Here, I create various and engaging forms of technical documentation that cover various types of topics, products, and services for *no charge* and for *all to use!* I will also post about general technical topics, concepts, how-to guides, tutorials, recommendations, and more.

This site couldn't have been built without [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator with the [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). This site is also configured with `GitHub Actions` for automatic deployment to this site's host, `GitHub Pages`, whenever I push changes on the CLI or on GitHub. This site will be live and accessible **24/7**, and since it's all open source, you can view it here on [GitHub](https://github.com/SalihWarsama/salihwarsama.github.io)!
