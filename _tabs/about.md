# Hello!
My name is Salih, a `Technical Communications` graduate from `The Ohio State University` and currently working as a `Freelance Technical Writer` in the US.

## Education
At Ohio State, I did extensive `User Experience(UX)` research and created several studies with my collegues to collect and analyze users' problems in various product designs, with my most notable study being the `Google AI Overview`. My team effectively pinpointed user pain points of these designs and created prototypes that users, backed by statistically significant data, overwhelmingly found more useful, reliable, easy to use, and satisfactory.

## Why Technical Writing?
After graduating, my gears shifted. Sure, I still enjoyed helping others through research and data analytics, but I wanted to help *more* people with *more* things, outside of just design. So, I decided to create tutorials and such for others online, which at the time **I didn't even know was an occupation!**

## Current Focus: This!
Now, I'm working on this ~~passion project~~ blog that you see right now! Here, I create various and engaging forms of technical documentation that cover various types of topics, products, and services for *no charge* and for *all to use!* I will also post about general technical topics, concepts, how-to guides, tutorials, recommendations, and more.

## Who Is This For?
For anyone who is willing to expand their technical expertise in general or in specific areas, such as writing, research, design, or if you're only interested in practical things such as what resources I use: **this site is for you!**

## How I Made This Site
This site couldn't have been built without [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator with the [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). This site is also configured with `GitHub Actions` for automatic deployment to this site's host, `GitHub Pages`, whenever I push changes on the CLI or on GitHub. This site will be live and accessible **24/7**, and since it's all open source, you can view it here on [GitHub](https://github.com/SalihWarsama/salihwarsama.github.io)!
